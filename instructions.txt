format: python3 fcrypt.py --option <public.pem or private.pem>  <source file>  <destination file>  
Please use public.pem for encryption and private.pem for decryption

Instructions using demo file:
	To encrypt:  python3 fcrypt.py --encrypt public.pem secret.txt encrypted.txt
	To decrypt:  python3 fcrypt.py --decrypt private.pem encrypted.txt decrypted.txt

I was able to complete the assignment successfully and there will be a screenshot proving it
included in the package.

What this program will do:
	Encryption:
		- Take source file and encrypt it with AES encryption
		- Encrypts AES key with RSA encryption using the public key file, and stores it as aes.text
	Decryption:
		- Takes private key file and decrypts the AES key
		- Decrypts the source file
